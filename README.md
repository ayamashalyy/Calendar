# Calendar

Just published a fully native **Calendar component** using UIKit!

This is not based on any third-party library â€” it's built from scratch using native iOS components and custom logic.

I created this calendar as a reusable module, and you're welcome to use or contribute to it in your own UIKit-based iOS projects.
